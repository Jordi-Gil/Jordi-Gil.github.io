<center><a> Welcome to my website. </a> </center>

Hello, my name is Jordi Gil and I'm a computer scientist who loves computer graphics and video games. Mainly, I love offline rendering methods like Path Tracing.

I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science of Barcelona at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). During my studies, I course different subjects relative to computer graphics and video games. Indeed, my final degree project was about Path Tracing with various implementations in CPU and GPU.

I'm very interested in Computer Graphics, Video game development and Software Engineering in general. I usually explore [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Stackexchange](https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Unreal Engine](https://forums.unrealengine.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Unity](https://forum.unity.com/){:target="_blank"} forums to discover new stuff. Also, I love reading papers relative to rendering methods and, of course, play video games!
