## Features

I'm a computer scientist who loves graphics and video games. Mainly, I love offline rendering methods like Path Tracing.

I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science of Barcelona at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). During my studies, I course different subjects relative to computer graphics and video games. Indeed, my final degree project was about Path Tracing with various implementations in CPU and GPU.
