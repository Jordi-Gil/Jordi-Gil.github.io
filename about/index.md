<center><a> Welcome to my website. </a> </center>

Hello, my name is Jordi Gil and I'm a computer scientist who loves graphics and video games. Mainly, I love offline rendering methods like Path Tracing.

I studied Computer Science at the Faculty of Computer Science of Barcelona at the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). During my studies, I course different subjects relative to computer graphics and video games. Indeed, my final degree project was about Path Tracing with various implementations in CPU and GPU.

## Favorite Topics

I'm very interested in Computer Graphics, Video game development and Software Engineering in general. I usually explore [Github](https://github.com/), [Stackexchange](https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://forums.unrealengine.com/) and [Unity](https://forum.unity.com/) forums to discover new stuff. Also, I love reading papers relative to rendering methods and, of course, play video games!
