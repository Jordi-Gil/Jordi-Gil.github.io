This project comes from the necessity to make a game for the Master Degree in Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games. Instead of use any existing commercial game engine like Unity or Unreal, we needed to develop our in-house engine in C++. This is the most ambitious project I never work until now. Not only for the aim to develop a whole game engine, but also to cooperate with a huge team and coordinated it. I help to create the Animations module where, with a colleague, we immplemented the skinning algorithm both in CPU and GPU, to enumerate one.

As a Lead Gameplaye Progammer, I was in charge of create thw scripting workflow. We decided to use C++ and inject all the scripts using DLLs to speed up the development using hot-reloading. Also, as a one of the leads, I reviewed a great part of all the pull request created in the repository to assure the quality and good programming practices.

You can check the code in the repossitory [Tesseract](https://github.com/TBD-org/Tesseract){:target="_blank"}. Also, here you can see some images from the engine.
